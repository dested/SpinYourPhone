Package
=======

Simple package building for AMD

What is it?
-----------
Package lets you build AMD packages. It's easiest to show you with an example, so check out [Uniter](https://github.com/asmblah/uniter) for an example of a project using Package.

It lets you solve the problem of defining package-specific path mappings more easily.

Bower
-----
Add 'package' to your `bower.json`.
